# ASCII-art-index

Being inspired by Hacktoberfest, created this repository where anyone can make pull requests.

## How to contribute?

1. crawl the internet and find the best ASCII art
2. create a file named after a theme (ex: cats, dogs, funny, etc) and add them there. Please include the source of the ASCII in the file
3. add a link to newly created file to the index below
4. open an issue and submit a PR. Don't forget to add label 'Hacktoberfest' to the issue
5. enjoy your submission

For anyone new out there, here is a really good tutorial:
